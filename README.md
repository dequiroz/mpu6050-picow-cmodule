## ðŸ“¦ Overview

This repository wraps the C++ driver code for the MPU6050 IMU sensor and its Digital Motion Processor (DMP), making it accessible as a MicroPython C module on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

It is intended for robotics, motion tracking, and educational use, where performance and accuracy are important but where full C development is impractical.
